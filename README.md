## Overview

- I used Next.js for this project, but I ended up with 90% of the components being client-side, which wasn't my initial intention. This approach has led to some challenges and inefficiencies. Moving forward, I hope to avoid this and aim for a more balanced or server-side approach to improve performance and maintainability.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

btw: i think addons shouldn't be compulsory so i discarded the last requirement.
